      Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an
      understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between
      organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are
      a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

      We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you.
      That’s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and
      schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow
      and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
